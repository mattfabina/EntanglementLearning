This Java project simulates the web game Entanglement with AI-based learning:
(http://entanglement.gopherwoodstudios.com/)

Written before Artificial Intelligence course (CS 577), speculates heavily on
proper learning computer design.

Features include loading memory from text files, simulating games rapidly,
watching the simulator play a game, and simulator learning based on tweaking the
weights that the simulator uses to make in-game decisions.

Frameworks for a more sophisticated and dynamic memory have been laid down, but
benefits compared to the current static memory seem marginal at the moment.

No known bugs. Not very well documented.

Includes memory template and sample memory.
